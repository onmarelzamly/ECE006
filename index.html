<p>From the start I say that we need to define intelligence and define what we mean by human intelligence. The stage of intelligence applies to any situation seeking to solve complex problems. According to the Oxford dictionary definition, intelligence is the ability to understand, learn and think. There are a number of capabilities that can be considered indicators of intelligence, namely: learning or understanding from experience, extracting meaning from a matter that is likely to mean that extracting meaning from conflicting or conflicting messages. From this definition it can be concluded that if I am on the machine some kind of intelligence then we must have created three abilities in it: understanding, learning, thinking.
So the new way of trying to simulate human intelligence has created an emergency of new science called artificial intelligence. There are different definitions of artificial intelligence, as one of its meanings (in the words of John McCarthy who launched it at the Dartmouth Conference) is to make the machine behave in a way that can be called intelligence if humans behave the way the machine behaves. We have found artificial intelligence to give the computer the ability to solve problems and make the right decisions in a logical way. (1971) he says that the goal of artificial intelligence is to build machines that carry out tasks that require human intelligence in normal situations. However, all of these definitions describe one meaning, which is simulating human intelligence. The field of artificial intelligence has opened up new technological applications such as robotics, expert systems, games, language processing (NLP) and image and shape recognition. The subject of artificial intelligence has evolved with many sciences. In addition, innovations related to new computer systems inspired by biological sciences clearly demonstrate that this science is multifaceted knowledge.
