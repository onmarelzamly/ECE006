<h1>APPlications of APPlications Intelligence</h1>
<p>Itis used in a wide range of areas such as: expert systems, medical diagnostics, Internet search engines, natural language processing, video games, stock trading, law, image discrimination and analysis, toys, scientific discoveries, automatic control, and voice recognition.
The healthcare field is developing with increasing speed, accompanied by a significant increase in the amount of data and challenges in terms of costs and patient outcomes; So artificial intelligence applications have been used to reduce these challenges, [1] The following are the most important examples of the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in this field: Predicting ICU Transfers: Unplanned transfer of patients to the intensive care unit can lead to poor results, and in some cases it may even lead to the death of patients; So artificial intelligence was used to reduce the proportion of these cases, by finding patients with serious cases, where artificial intelligence systems use patients ’medical records, laboratory results, and vital signs to manage patients’ condition before it deteriorates, and having to transfer them to the intensive care unit, and it can guide Artificial intelligence 
systems doctors to the point of treatment initiation. [2] Medical Testing: Performing unnecessary routine lab tests increases unnecessary financial costs; Therefore, AI applications have been used to narrow the circle of laboratory analyzes that a patient may need.
